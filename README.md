	Here are some projects I have done from a game we all played to pizza we all love!

[TicTacToe](https://github.com/tylerlynn13/Javascript-Projects/files/13467072/TicTacToe.zip)
	
 Your regular game of tic tac toe, each player can choose X or O and play against eachother and whoever wins gets a light show!
		
[Pizza Project](https://github.com/tylerlynn13/Javascript-Projects/files/13467075/Pizza.Project.zip)

Just as it sounds, you can order a pizza with your choice of toppings and size!

[Calculator](https://github.com/tylerlynn13/Javascript-Projects/files/13467084/Calculator.zip)
	
You can use it with math problems that include, subtraction, adding, divison, multiplying.
